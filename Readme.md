# Rama #

This isn't really a thing. It's a from-scratch, hobby-ish project. The kind of thing you'd
be stupid to build yourself because there are dozens available already.

Rama is another api server framework.

There are many like it, but this one is mine.

And, actually, calling it a framework implies that there's code that works. That is not the case. Think of this
more as a scratchpad of ideas, some work, some don't.

## Goals ##

 * to solve all the problems I've had with every other framework
 * to make async possible and easy where necessary; invisible where not.
 * targeted at backend/API server development, not so much web development.
 * less DSL-ish. More toolbox-ish.
